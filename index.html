            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p><em>Indian king</em> from the Paramara dynasty. His kingdom was centered around the Malwa 
                region in central India, where his capital Dhara-nagara (modern Dhar) was located.
                He fought wars with nearly all his neighbours in attempts to extend his kingdom,
                with varying degrees of success. At its zenith, his empire extended from Chittor in
                the north to upper Konkan in the south, and from the Sabarmati River in the west to
                Vidisha in the east.</p>
